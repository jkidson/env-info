## **Content**
        
  + My [GP](www2.bren.ucsb.edu/~sbwater) focuses on local water supply sustainability. 
  + My personal interests (not at Bren) include food and water security. How can we best manage our water, soil, and financial resources to provide for the basic needs of people, especially where climate change is happening?  
        
## **Techniques**
        
Becoming more comfortable with *programming* and *data imaging* will help our GP produce more presentable infographics of our findings.  
        
## **Data**
        
Data for the GP has largely been collected from local water agencies and the county (historical and projected data include metered sales, water supply by source, energy requirements by source, and costs).

library(stringr)
read.csv('sgriff_loadyields.csv')
#limit columns to just state and nitrogen 
#limit rows to states with nitrogen levels >= 1000 kg/yr/km^2
#get number of states with N >= 1000 kg/yr/km^2
#get list of states with N >= 1000 kg/yr/km^2

  mutate(nitrogen = as.numeric(stringr::str_replace_all(nitrogen, ',', ''))) %>%
