This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

  ## Content
        
  I wanna focus more on marine and coastal environment management, instead of just paying attention to the environment as a whole.
        
  ## Techniques
        
  I could use Excel well right now, and I am learning more technics :)
        
  ## Data
        
  I have got data from last quarter's data analysis classes. 

  
```{r}
# read csv
d = read.csv('data/adam1993_SurfperchData.csv')
      
# output summary
summary(d)
```
